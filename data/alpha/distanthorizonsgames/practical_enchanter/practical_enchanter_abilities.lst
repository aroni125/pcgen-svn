This is often well worthwhile.																											TEMPLATE:Poor Wealth ECL Modifier

# Wealth Level Selection Abilities that are grouped in that Tier. Note: Unable to Implement a step up as in the Above your Wealth Section. Would require something like alt ability to select. 
# Currently not worth the effort at the moment.

Wealth Level Perk / Armor, Shields, and Weapons		SOURCEPAGE:p.185	KEY:Wealth Template ~ Poor Equipment		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.WTPoor																																																																																																																																														BENEFIT:There really isn't any money to spare for this; staves, slings, clubs, improvised spears, and work knives, are about the limit. You can usually get someone to make up a crude suit of padded armor for you. Your best bet is to try to join the militia; that'll get you some basic gear, such as leather armor, spear, shortsword, small wooden shield, and a few javelins along with the training to use them effectively.
Wealth Level Perk / Magical Items				SOURCEPAGE:p.185	KEY:Wealth Template ~ Poor Magic			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.WTPoor																																																																																																																																														BENEFIT:One minor, and usually utilitarian, charm. Fire- and light- stones, healing charms, minor enhanced tools, and other handy items are the most common.
Wealth Level Perk / Mounts, Pets And Familiars		SOURCEPAGE:p.185	KEY:Wealth Template ~ Poor Companions		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.WTPoor																																																																																																																																														BENEFIT:Any animals you have are going to either be common, inexpensive working beasts or sources of food.

If you really need an assistant, you may be able to manage an apprentice, impressionable kid, or one of your relatives.
Wealth Level Perk / Training					SOURCEPAGE:p.185	KEY:Wealth Template ~ Poor Training			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.WTPoor																																																																																																																																														BENEFIT:Any character who levels while at this wealth level gains +2 SP to be spent on Profession, Craft, Bluff, or Gather Information, but it's rare for an adventurer to spend much time at this level.

Wealth Level Perk / Magical Items				SOURCEPAGE:p.186	KEY:Wealth Template ~ Common Magic			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.WTCommon																																																																																																																																														BENEFIT:Normally three minor "charms." At least at first, these will usually be utilitarian, but the definition of "utilitarian" can vary a good deal depending on the character's background.
Wealth Level Perk / Mounts, Pets, and Familiars		SOURCEPAGE:p.186	KEY:Wealth Template ~ Common Companions		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.WTCommon																																																																																																																																														BENEFIT:You can obtain common animals, a light riding horse (likely a bit long in the tooth, but serviceable) and a healthy mutt to act as a guard dog.

Wealth Level Perk / Retainers					SOURCEPAGE:p.186	KEY:Wealth Template ~ Common Retainers		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.WTCommon																																																																																																																																														BENEFIT:You may have a house- or errand-boy and know an old woman or man who purports to be a witch. For the most part you won't know anyone the least bit important.
Wealth Level Perk / Training					SOURCEPAGE:p.186	KEY:Wealth Template ~ Common Training		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.WTCommon																																																																																																																																														BENEFIT:Any character who levels while at this wealth level gains no special benefits, and suffers no unusual penalties.

# Current Wealth - Well Off
Wealth Level Perk / Armor, Shields, and Weapons		SOURCEPAGE:p.186	KEY:Wealth Template ~ Well Off Equipment		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.WTWellOff																																																																																																																																														BENEFIT:You can afford full plate armor, exotic weapons, longbows and specialized equipment. Still, at least for the time, masterwork equipment remains out of reach.
Wealth Level Perk / Magical Items				SOURCEPAGE:p.186	KEY:Wealth Template ~ Well Off Magic		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.WTWellOff																																																																																																																																														BENEFIT:Three charms and one talisman.
Wealth Level Perk / Mounts, Pets, and Familiars		SOURCEPAGE:p.186	KEY:Wealth Template ~ Well Off Companions		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.WTWellOff																																																																																																																																														BENEFIT:You can afford high quality common animals, trained warhorses, and so on. Exotic imports are still simply too expensive.
Wealth Level Perk / Retainers					SOURCEPAGE:p.186	KEY:Wealth Template ~ Well Off Retainers		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.WTWellOff																																																																																																																																														BENEFIT:You may have a single extremely loyal assistant, guard, or henchman, connections with assorted skilled professionals in various fields and a dozen or so ordinary employees.

Wealth Level Perk / Training					SOURCEPAGE:p.186	KEY:Wealth Template ~ Well Off Training		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.WTWellOff																																																																																																																																														BENEFIT:Any character who levels while at this wealth level gains no special benefits, and suffers no unusual penalties.

Wealth Level Perk / Legal Privileges			SOURCEPAGE:p.187	KEY:Wealth Template ~ Affluent Legal		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.WTAffluent																																																																																																																																													BENEFIT:Characters at this level enjoy a good deal of leeway about things like the use of deadly force against an "attacker," carrying armor, shields, and weapons, or riding in the city streets, and will virtually always get the benefit of the doubt unless the other side is even richer. It's also almost impossible to drive you insane; you're usually limited to eccentric.
Wealth Level Perk / Mounts, Pets, and Familiars		SOURCEPAGE:p.187	KEY:Wealth Template ~ Affluent Companions		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.WTAffluent																																																																																																																																													BENEFIT:You can afford exotic pets, like fine hawks and rare imported animals.

Wealth Level Perk / Legal Privileges			SOURCEPAGE:p.187	KEY:Wealth Template ~ Wealthy Legal			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.WTWealthy																																																																																																																																														BENEFIT:At this point you're virtually above the law; having the resources to fund private armies tends to have that effect. Those with grievances usually resort to outlaw tactics or even larger armies.
Wealth Level Perk / Magical Items				SOURCEPAGE:p.187	KEY:Wealth Template ~ Wealthy Magic			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.WTWealthy																																																																																																																																														BENEFIT:Seven charms and three talismans.

Wealth Level Perk / Skill Bonuses				SOURCEPAGE:p.187	KEY:Wealth Template ~ Wealthy Skill			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.WTWealthy																																																																																																																																														BENEFIT:+2 nameless bonus to Diplomacy, Gather Information, and Intimidate, thanks to the use of cash and high-quality gear.

Arcanum Minimus / Ambient Magic			SOURCEPAGE:p.126	KEY:Arcanum Minimus ~ Ambient Magic			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.ArcanumMinimusFeatChoice									DESC:Conventionally used to power cantrips and trivial talismans, ambient magical energy is freely available, but very weak. The casting time increases greatly - from free actions to actions, from actions to minutes, and from minutes to hours. Ambient magic cannot power spells that normally require more than ten minutes to cast.
Arcanum Minimus / Catalyst Materials		SOURCEPAGE:p.126	KEY:Arcanum Minimus ~ Catalyst Materials		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.ArcanumMinimusFeatChoice									DESC:The magical forces which lie within certain materials selected by the game master (a vampire's fang, the dust from a dragon's eggshell, ogre magi blood, odd minerals and rare earths, magical woods, certain crystals, etc), may be tapped to power magic. Sadly, such materials are difficult to acquire and are only good for a limited number of castings of particular spells before their power is exhausted.
Arcanum Minimus / Powers of Chaos			SOURCEPAGE:p.126	KEY:Arcanum Minimus ~ Powers of Chaos		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.ArcanumMinimusFeatChoice									DESC:Calling on the powers of Chaos to aid you is straightforward, but reckless. The caster must save against his or her own spell (use Will if no save is specified): On a "1", it goes drastically wrong and produces a wild magical effect rather than what you want. On a failure, or a "2" in any case, it is somewhat distorted or has strange side effects (treat as a secondary spell of up to one-half of the original spell's power level).
Arcanum Minimus / Life Energy				SOURCEPAGE:p.126	KEY:Arcanum Minimus ~ Life Energy			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.ArcanumMinimusFeatChoice									DESC:One of the most common sources of extra energy for spells, but also one of the least friendly, this technique draws out the internal strength of the caster. Spellcasters using this energy source may draw on their own life force, either saving against their own spell (Will if no save is listed) to avoid fatigue (doing this twice causes the exhausted state as usual) or expending HP (usually Spell Level/2 d6), XP (5 per spell level), or temporary attribute drain (usually 1d4) in the spellcasting. Ruthless mages may draw on the life energy of sacrifices (small animals and large plants will suffice for low-level spells; a ninth level spell might require multiple sentient beings), or on the surrounding environment. Using this option reduces soil and vegetation to lifeless ash in a radius of roughly 3 feet per level of the spell, a condition that may persist for lengthy periods. This is definitely an evil act and is unpopular with everything dependent on the land.
Arcanum Minimus / Magical Devices			SOURCEPAGE:p.126	KEY:Arcanum Minimus ~ Magical Devices		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.ArcanumMinimusFeatChoice									DESC:The energies stored within charged, or "uses-per-day", magical items may provide power for compatible spells. Simply enough, this depletes one charge or use per spell. Certain items, such as the Rod of Wonder, are compatible with almost any spell. The GM must rule on compatibility for other items. In general, a similar effect or descriptor is compatible.
Arcanum Minimus / Powers of Darkness		SOURCEPAGE:p.126	KEY:Arcanum Minimus ~ Powers of Darkness		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.ArcanumMinimusFeatChoice									DESC:The forces of corruption are always ready to supply quick and easy power - for a price. Black magic slowly twists and warps thosewho use it, leaving a taint that's difficult to purge away. This is represented by an accumulating Corruption score. Calling on black magic normally results in 1d4 points of corruption. When your corruption score exceeds your current Will save (plus constant bonuses) plus your stage of descent you must make a Will save (DC 13 if you've been using your magic for good purposes, 16 if you've been using it for a general tool, 21 if you've been using it for selfish or evil purposes) or descend a step into the power of evil. On a success, the mage has resisted the temptations of the powers of darkness. In either case, the corruption score resets to zero. Barring such a dramatic resolution, a character's corruption score falls by one point a week automatically, by one point a day via penance, rituals, or meditation in a holy place, and by 1d4 points whenever the character makes a great commitment to good or a major sacrifice in its pursuit.
Arcanum Minimus / Powers of Light			SOURCEPAGE:p.126	KEY:Arcanum Minimus ~ Powers of Light		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.ArcanumMinimusFeatChoice									DESC:The powers of light are stern and demanding masters, as pure and terrible as the fires of the sun. The price of drawing upon such power is purity of purpose, mind, and spirit: being a sword to stand against the darkness. This is hell on your social life. Unfortunately, unless a character lives up to very high standards, his or her spells start fizzling as the powers that be, whatever they are, decline to help him or her out. Optionally, similar benefits can be derived from the Lords of Order, but such entities issue endless orders and directives. Few mortals care to call on them.
Arcanum Minimus / Karmic Debts			SOURCEPAGE:p.126	KEY:Arcanum Minimus ~ Karmic Debts			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.ArcanumMinimusFeatChoice									DESC:Calling on supernatural beings to help you out has one basic flaw: they tend to want you to return the favor, and are powerful enough to enforce such a debt. While they rarely call upon low level characters, truly powerful individuals make truly useful pawns. Karmic debts are unlikely to be a problem at first, but lead to many unanticipated adventures later. As a variation, a character might be linked with some sort of minor entity, which the caster must keep happy if he or she wishes to continue using such spells. In either case, the karmic creditor sends irresistible curses if the character refuses to pay up.
Arcanum Minimus / Reduced Power			SOURCEPAGE:p.126	KEY:Arcanum Minimus ~ Reduced Power			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.ArcanumMinimusFeatChoice									DESC:This isn't actually a power source; it's what happens when a spell is cast without building up the power to do it properly, usually due to failure to fulfill other conditions from this list. Spells suffer a -2 on the DC of saving against them and a -4 on the effective caster level per "missing" condition. Factors such as duration and range are reduced as the game master wishes. A few very high-level mages may not care ("So who cares if it only goes off at L12? It maxes out at 10!"), but lesser magi need every scrap of power they can muster.
Arcanum Minimus / Special Conditions		SOURCEPAGE:p.126	KEY:Arcanum Minimus ~ Special Conditions		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.ArcanumMinimusFeatChoice									DESC:The spell is more restricted than usual. It may require peculiar environmental conditions (e.g., moonlight), that the caster possess special knowledge or skills (such as a target's "True Name" or an extensive knowledge of biophysics), won't affect certain targets, and so on. In general, this is a catch-all category. On the other hand, if the limitation doesn't really limit the spell, it certainly doesn't count. A Fireball which only affects enemies is improved, not restricted. In general, mages shouldn't make a habit of using many of these; special conditions should be closely tied to the character concept or an integral part of very special spells. Optionally, the game master may permit spells to gain up to a -3 level modifier from special conditions, provided that they are both extremely specific (e.g. only during the great once-a-century conjunction at the Gate of Ebon while holding the Scepter of Night) and have been built into the spell formula.

Enchantment / Bonded					SOURCEPAGE:p.131	KEY:Enchantment ~ Bonded				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.EnchantmentFeatChoice									DESC:Spells from the item use the wielder's caster level and attribute modifiers if those are better than its own. This usually increases the sale price by 20%%; it does not increase the base cost for making an item.
Enchantment / Excellence				SOURCEPAGE:p.131	KEY:Enchantment ~ Excellence				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.EnchantmentFeatChoice									DESC:Your items use your full attribute bonus to determine the DC of saving against them rather than the minimum required to cast the spell.

Enchantment / Living Magic				SOURCEPAGE:p.131	KEY:Enchantment ~ Living Magic			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.EnchantmentFeatChoice									DESC:You may enchant living or undead creatures, including your own flesh and blood. This can also embed magic in words, ideas, songs, computer programs, and other intangible "items". Use-activated spells embedded in creatures are usually used by them at will or activate when triggered. Words are spoken, songs sung, and ideas concentrated on. You may transfer intangible items to other characters. The original character may still know the song, word, or idea, but it will no longer possess any power.
Enchantment / Multiple					SOURCEPAGE:p.131	KEY:Enchantment ~ Multiple				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.EnchantmentFeatChoice									DESC:You may place multiple spell formulas in the same item, although all must use the same caster level. The cost is based on the highest level spell used plus 75%% of the value of the next highest level spell plus 50%% of the value of any other spells used. You may reduce the cost of a particular spell by increasing the number of charges it costs to use (2 for half cost, 3 for one third, etc, up to a limit of 5 for one fifth).

Harvest of Artifice / Philosopher's Stone		SOURCEPAGE:p.131	KEY:Harvest of Artifice ~ Philosopher's Stone	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.HarvestOfArtificeFeatChoice								DESC:This application requires both Alchemic Mastery and Transmutation. It allows both effects to be stored in an alchemical talisman, to be used at the option of the possessor. In the case of Transmutation, the holder of the item can use it to transmute materials even without possessing this feat.
Harvest of Artifice / Transmutation			SOURCEPAGE:p.131	KEY:Harvest of Artifice ~ Transmutation		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.HarvestOfArtificeFeatChoice								DESC:You may infuse XP into material to transmute it into more useful forms.

This usually increases the sale price by 20%%, it does not increase the base cost for making an item. Optionally, you may set the base caster level of a bonded item of this type to one, regardless of the level of the spell, but if you take this option, the user must supply the power required to use the spell in the form of an appropriate unused spell slot.
