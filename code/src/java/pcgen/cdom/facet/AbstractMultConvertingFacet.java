/**
 * @author Thomas Parker (thpr [at] yahoo.com)
 * 
 * A AbstractMultConvertingFacet is a DataFacet that converts information from
 * one type to another when the source of that object should be tracked.
 * 
 * This class is designed to assume that each original object may only be
 * contained one time by the PlayerCharacter, even if received from multiple
 * sources. The original object will only trigger one DATA_ADDED event (when
 * added by the first source) and if removed by some sources, will only trigger
 * one DATA_REMOVED event (when it is removed by the last remaining source).
 * Sources do not need to be removed in the order in which they are added, and
 * the first source to be added does not possess special status with respect to
 * triggering a DATA_REMOVED event (it will only trigger removal if it was the
 * last source when removed)
 * 
 * The sources stored in this AbstractMultConvertingFacet are stored as a List,
 * meaning the list of sources may contain the same source multiple times. If
 * so, each call to remove will only remove that source one time from the list
 * of sources.
 * 
 * null is a valid source.
